/**
 * A ListenableRequest that complies with RFC 2616, allowing for non GET / HEAD
 * methods to invalidate the cache (notice DEPRECATED_GET_OR_POST is not supported).
 *
 * Volley is awesome, but is too eager to cache stuff, so it does not complies to RFC 2616,
 * in particular with Section 13.10, which states:
 * <pre>Some HTTP methods MUST cause a cache to invalidate an entity.
	This is either the entity referred to by the Request-URI, or by
	the Location or Content-Location headers (if present). These methods are:
      - PUT
      - DELETE
      - POST</pre>
 * Nor with Section 13.11, which states:
 * <pre>All methods that might be expected to cause modifications to the
 	origin server's resources MUST be written through to the origin server.
 	This currently includes all methods except for GET and HEAD.
 	A cache MUST NOT reply to such a request from a client before having
 	transmitted the request to the inbound server, and having received a
 	corresponding response from the inbound server. This does not prevent
 	a proxy cache from sending a 100 (Continue) response before the inbound
 	server has sent its final reply.</pre>
 * In other words, Volley will not hit the origin server for any request (not even POST / PUT /DELETE)
 * if for that very url there is an item in cache.
 * 
 * Bare in mind this isn't 100% spec compliant. The cache is not checked before performing the request
 * but it's also used to actually store the response, shall it bring
